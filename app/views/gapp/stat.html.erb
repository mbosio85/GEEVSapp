<h2>GEEVS Data Analysis	(Beta Version)</h2>

	<p>
	Aggregation of variant frequencies from multiple studies has been done separately for Illumina and Solid platform based calls.
	Illumina based SNV calls have been produced by GATK UnifiedGenotyper's multi-sample calling,separately for each study of at least 50 cases.
	Resulting VCF files need to fulfill various filter criteria to be considered for aggregation, e.g. percent recall in dbSNP, 
	TiTv ratio as well as high correlation to 1000genomes and EVS. Furthermore all reported variants are filtered in the following manner:	
	</br>
	</p>
	<ul>
      	<li> Only variants located in the corresponding exome enrichment kit from each site were considered.</li>
      	<li> Only chromosome 1-22, X and Y were considered.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some aggregation statistics are given below.</p>
