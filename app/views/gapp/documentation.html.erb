<h2>Search variants by Chromosome and Position</h2>

	<p>
	You can search variants by providing appropriate chromosome, start and end position. These three fields are mandatory for searching variants. 
	You can also modify your search criteria such as select which sequencing platform you want to query. Selecting a similar platform for your 
	sequencing projects can be more meaningful, since variant caller’s result depend on the data provided. You can also select the pre-annotated gene definition, 
	exonic function and variant function. Finally, there is another optional filter criteria Allele Frequency. You can be dynamic while using this field in various ways. 
	It supports greater than (>), greater than or equal (>=) and so on. Supported formats are:</br>
	</p>
	<ul>
      	<li> Greater than ( > )</li>
      	<li> Greater than or Equal( >= )</li>
      	<li> Less than ( < )</li>
      	<li> Less than or Equal ( <=)</li>
      	<li> Equal to ( = )</li>
      	<li> Not Equal to ( != )</li>
      	<li> Between / Range ( <> )</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Search variants by Gene</h2>
	
	<p>
	You can also search variants by HGNC approved Gene Names or Ensembl gene identifiers. The other fields are similar to “Chromsome and Position” search panel. 
	If you are searching variants by Ensembl gene identifiers, then you must select Ensembl gene definition in the Gene Definition select box. You can find more about 
	HGNC gene names <%= link_to :here , "http://www.genenames.org/", class: "nav_links_body" %>. For Ensembl gene identifers you can check 
	<%= link_to :here , "http://www.ensembl.org/index.html", class: "nav_links_body" %>.

<h2>Annotation</h2>
	<p>
		All the variants were annotated at the Genomic and Epigenomic Variations in Disease research group in Center for Genomic Regulation - CRG, Barcelona. 
		Annotation was done by an inhouse developed tool with Annovar* integrated inside.
